# :cry: nostalgic to look back :cry:

### For my first year at college we were tasked with making a multitude of applications, i am not neccessarily over the moon with the layout of this project _NOW_, but as my first and most major project so far I am still very proud and it merited me a splendid 89/100 :rocket:!

##### In this project you will find:
> 2 versions of a comission calculator

> A student grade calculator

> A miles to km table

> An application that works out an average from an undefined set of numbers

> A basic test of our loop knowledge

> A blood compatability converter

### I like to think i may of approached this a bit more eloquently now, but still a cool first project!

## :shipit: happy hacking :shipit:
